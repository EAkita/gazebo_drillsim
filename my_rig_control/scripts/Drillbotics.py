If there’s latency, try the compressed image – this is in the rqt thing
*Add the GUI for the explanation  


*Use Tenessee_ SW 35 600 as demo 
*IL_SW 50_350 data (354_355 add on)
*IL_SW 50 600 – two possible starts – WOB difference 
*SW Notes excel file – you don’t have to worry about it
Nothing in the directional well data yet – will follow up with data analysis after I take the measurementt – the sensor will be in next week. 

Other things you could have looked at 
Look at the time value – in order - 
Look at the amount of drilling done – too short; throw away 
Look at the file name – eg. ###_test

*I consolidated the files
1. Use the Legend in the ReadMe file and color-code the columns needed
2. Color code the  “start of drilling” row; use the base torque- it’s between 4 – 6.5 for the “True torque eqn”
3. Start of drilling is around 1.5 – 1.6 ft (Untitled 4); but some are around 1 inch
4. Monitor WOB closely with start of drilling
5. monitor the torque and look for a spike in value
6. monitor ROP closely – at the beginning it is high for some, since the rig descended quickly, then you get small value. For the high WOB tests, if it broke through the sample, the ROP goes up towards the end. Take this value out. Always try to end the analysis where the ROP seems to taper off at a “max” value.
Ignore “0” ROP
ROP could be the limiting factor
Remember to apply the 30% efficiency factor for MSE 

All equations for analysis are here
 Do for all – at leastt 20 minutes, then use the first 10 minutes for the analysis – Reason – some have only like 12 or 20 minutes of drilling data 
Bit area value is constant; RPM value changes

Analyze all data in sheet 2 #
if drill_time < 10 min	
	extrapolate to 10 minnutes - Look at the SW summary excel file to get an idea – column J under “Rotary_SW (+30%) tab
For those with > 10 minutes of data , analyse everything, then analyze also for only 10 minutes
